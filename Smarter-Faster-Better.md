## Smarter Faster Better
by Charles Duhigg

### Theme 1: Motivation
* pg 14: Striatum seems connected to loss of motivation. Motivation here is broadly defined to mean taking action under one's own initiative. The individuals who suffered striatum damage would still respond to external prompts normally.

* pg 17: Having a feeling of control in an otherwise identical scenario engages participants and makes them enjoy the experience more. A sense of agency and control has intrinsic value.
    > This is important when making decisions that involve other people. Even if you think you know the best answer, and are unwilling to compromise, it pays off to approach the interaction as if it's up to all parties.

* pg 19: A fundamental pre-requisite for self-motivation (which is associated with overall life satisfaction), is a sense of agency. Humans crave control affirming actions, and thus prefer having choice even if it confers no additional reward.

* pg 20: Given the above, one can make simple choices to help feel in control, then bootstrap that sense of control to make harder choices and so forth.
    > When you have a daunting task to handle, break it down into a collection of choices and go for the low hanging fruit. 

* pg 23: Locus of Control, is a measure of how much one internalizes responsibility for outcomes. So someone with a high locus of control will attribute success or failure to their hardwork. It has been linked with self-motivation, maturity, less stress and depression and a longer life span. 
	> By parsing external events as something under your control, you're more likely to improve the parts of them that you actually have control over. It's rare that someone has actually done "everything within their power" to change something.

* pg 24: You can influence someone's locus of control by attaching them to outcomes in the world. E.g praising children for hard work vs intelligence.

* pg 26: An important aspect of Locus of Control development is emphasizing gains in areas people don't already identify with. Don't focus on what someone already thinks they're good at. Focus on what was hard.

* pg 30: Make a chore into a meaningful decision and self-motivation will arise.

* pg 35: Damage to Striatum is potentially more about attaching emotions to raw outcomes. 
	>This is a stark reminder of the whole emotions are prime motivators thing.

* pg 36: Whenever something unpleasant is occurring, ask yourself "why"

#### Summary
	Self-motivation is the result of connecting insignificant and small actions to a larger meaning. Getting into the habit of reframing those small events into an important whole is how someone continues to improve.
