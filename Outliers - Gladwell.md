### Summary
#### The Matthew Effect 
- "For whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them"
- Compounding advantages is for real
  - Early birthday (high level athletes all have early birthdays)
  - better, earlier education
  - successful parents who pass on knowledge/strategies
  - having capital to invest, avoid taxes

#### 10,000 hours of practice are needed for mastery (no exceptions)
- natural talent or lack thereof only changes this number by ~10%
- natural talent DOES seems to increase the desire/willingness to practice
- natural talent DOES expose you to the cumulitive advantage of the Matthew Effect
- most child prodigies had their 10,000 hours by the time they were producing their master works 
  - Mozart
  - Bill Joy
  - Bill Gates
  - The Beatles
#### The Trouble with Geniuses
- IQ and grades have decreasing predictive value as they increase past a certain point
- Less qualified minority students become just as successful after a Law degree at the University of Michigan as their, initially, more qualified white counterparts
- Emotional intelligence and other cognitive abilities are important predictors of success
- Different intelligences are orthogonal; the presence of one does not imply the other
- Children of wealthy parents are raised with a sense of entitlement, that they are an agent in the world and with enough training they can become an authority
- Wealthy parents intentionally cultivate their children
  - teach and practice a wide range of skills, 
  - train them for success in the modern social world, 
  - teach them to reason with and question authority
- Poor parents do not cultiveate their children
  - They view their childs growth as natural and inevitable
  - They teach a deference to authority
- Of 730 of the original Terman Geniuses, the least successful all/mostly came from poor backgrounds
#### Success as a Product of Environment
