How To Read a Book - Mortimer J. Adler

There are 4 levels or ways of reading, all require work and attention
The 4 levels are:
- Elementary - Understanding the words
- Inspectional - Knowing what the book/work is about
- Analytical - Rigorously reading and understanding the book
- Synoptical - Using many books to answer a signle question posed by the reader

### Elementary

### Inspectional

##### Stage 1 (Figure out what the book is about, if you want to read it, and if so, what parts)
- Read the Title
- Read the Publishers blerb/the dust jacket
- Read the Table of contents
- Read the Index
- Read the Preface
- Find the primary chapters, read their intros, conclusions/summeries
- Sample the rest of the book, dipping in here and there to get a feel for writing/argumentation style. Never more than a paragraph at a time

##### Stage 2 (prepare for analytical reading, get an idea of the book's structure and main points)
- Skim the whole book. You are looking for key words, phrases, and if possible high level ideas. Don't stop to re-read or understand.
- Vary your reading speed based on the informational density

### Analytical
The goal of analytical reading is to be able to:
- State the unity of the book susinctly
- State and cite the major arguments and evidence supporting them. Ie. You sould be able to outline the book
- State what the problems/questions the author is trying to address? (What class of question is it? Existence, causal relationship, behaviour of a system, etc.)
- State the solutions to these problems (as supported by the major arguments and evidence)

To achieve this we practice the following:
- Find out what kind of book it is and read it accordingly (I won't go into this. This summary assumes we are reading non-fiction)
- Be Demanding as a reader
  - Vigourously note take, in and out of the book
  - Link to other ideas, explicitly contextualize new knowledge
  - Summarize each chapter once you finish it
  - Highlight key ideas and passages (Namely any paragraphs/sentances that shows their key proposition and evidence)
- Answer the following questions
  - What is the book about as a whole? What does it say? State this in one or two lines
  - What are the arguments/main points?
  - What evidence or reasoning is given to support each argument
  - What of the above is true, debatable, or false?
  - Does what the author says matter? If so, what of it?
  - What questions posed by the author were not answered?
- Find out the context of the book
  - Historical (policical, economic, cultural, social, religious aspects)
  - Author (Who were they, what else did they write, what were their influences and biases)
  - Why was the book written?
  - What are other books on this subject? Where does this one lie in the literature (This is closer to synoptical reading)
Note that good reading is a skill, you must practice, and you will improve over time.

### Synoptical

The purpose of synoptical reading is to review the literature on a particular subject to answer questions posed by the reader
- Unlike analytical reading we are permitted to read only the parts of the book that we care about

1. Create a bibliography of the books in the subject area you are concerned with
1. Inspect all these books
1. Read each as much or as little as it merits

- Find the relevant passages
- Understand the authors key terms/proper nouns, and what she means by them
- Have your own set of key terms that all of the authors' terms map back to
- Have a set questions you are answering
- Understand the discussion in the literature as a whole, 
  - Be able to explain and cite each part or side of it
Be objective. Investigate all sides, take none.
