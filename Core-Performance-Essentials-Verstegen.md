## Introduction
- Everyone is an athelete in the game of life
- Forget toned muscle and the perfect weight, the most important thing is physical and mental well-being to ensure a productive day-to-day existence and long and healthy life
- Fitness is a lifelong struggle against ever increasing resistance, and you have not choice but to face up to the challenge. The alternative is low physical and mental energy levels, chronic pain, and general poor health
- Have you gotten better/invesed in yourself by the end of each day? Or have you "merely endured another day of making a living"?
- All side efects considered, it costs you much less time and energy to be fit and healthy than not
- The four components of a healthy life are mindset, nutrition, exercise, and recovery.

## Mindset
- "Successful people are drive by core values that permeate every fiber of their being. By defining success through these calue and applying it to the roles you play in life, it's possible to accoplish anything. Unlike many people in out self-centered society, we each want to be a centered-self, using these values to fuel for our daily lives and to obtain our longterm goals
- You have to have long term plan for any exercise or diet regime to work
- You have to want it; fitness presenteeism is not enough
- Define your meaning of success
- Define your core values
- Define the roles you play in life
- This book will push you to be a centered self, as opposed to self centered, so that you can achieve your goals and uplift others
- Determination, Consistency, Teamwork

## Nutrition
- Make healthy food easy to access; make unhealthy food hard to access. Stock your home and office with healthy, easy eats
- Replace coffee with a walk, brief exercise, or naps
- Eat often. Many (~6) small meals (this includes snacks) a day. This keeps the metabolism steady and actually reduces appetite overall
- Plan your meals ahead of time to reduce congnitive overhead of finding something to eat when you're hungry (which often leads to fast food or other unhealthy choices)
- "Low nutrient, high sugar, high fat food robs us of energy, produce nasty mood swings that affect our relationships and decision making , and increase body fat"
- In the long run, eating healthy saves you time and money, and is delicious
- When hungry, the body consumes lean muscle first, and keeps fat as long as possible. People who lose weight by fasting become skinny-fat
- Pg. 34 Various meal schedules
- The body often struggles to properly digest and extract nutrients from a meal when you over eat, leading you to feel bloated and tired. 
- Protien sources (fish, poultry, etc) need only be about the size of a pack of cards, and starches (rice, pasta) can be the size of a baseball. Try using a smaller plate
- On the otherhand, it's difficult to eat too many veggies :P
- Eat protien rich snack a bit before bed, to prevent your body consuming lean muscle for protein until you next eat
- We need all of fats, carbs, protiens, and fibers in our diets
- Carbs should be consumed in porportion to your (daily, and even hourly) activity level
- Every meal should have fruits and veggies because they are high in nutrients and fibre
- Eat a rainbow
- Bias towards unprocessed foods
- pg. 35-43 Detailed analysis of different types of fats, carbs, protiens, and fibers and what foods to find them in.
- Hydrate. Drink 3-4 liters a day. Hydrate first thing in the morning. You will get huge performance gains for this
- Avoid sweetend/caffinated beverages. Easy wins
- Dehydration causes damage to the connective tissue in muscles and joint. Staying hydrates slows this degredation. You literally dry up and become crusty/brittle over time.
- Hydration regulate appetite
- Avoid sports drinks outside of serious sporting events
- pg 45. Discussion of alcohol

- Sleep is key
- Self massage (foam rollers)

- You should have a long term program spanning at least a year with benchmarks
