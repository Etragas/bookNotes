## Thoughts while reading books
by Elias

### Theme: Motivation
* Whenever you're doing something you don't enjoy but must do, reframe it as a way back to the things you do. That will help add meaning to the task at hand. For example, when having to implement something at work that you're not interested in, think about how doing so well will get your more credibility and increase your choices in the long term. Everything can be used to further your cause.
