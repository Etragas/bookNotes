## Thoughts while reading books
by Elias

### Theme: Motivation
* Whenever you're doing something you don't enjoy but must do, reframe it as a way back to the things you do. That will help add meaning to the task at hand. For example, when having to implement something at work that you're not interested in, think about how doing so well will get your more credibility and increase your choices in the long term. Everything can be used to further your cause.

### Theme: Planning
* It may be clever to block your time so that you always have an introspection period following some important event. Either that can be a code review, an important meeting or some discussion. 
What did you expect going in? 
What actually happened?
If there is a discrepancy, what caused it?

You shouldn't be entering a space without intention. To ensure that, always take 15 min before a meeting to plan its structure out, and 10 min after a meeting to reflect on how it went.

### Theme: Learning
* Everything someone else is teaching you has been experienced by them. When you read something, don't just parse it as words. Replay in your head exactly the scenario you're describing with you in their role. Live out the learnable moment, think about what you should do in that context.Try and map that back on to your day to day. If you can imagine real scenarios where you can use this knowledge, it's much more likely you'll recall the knowledge when it's appropriate.
